# SignsUi

To get up and running locally:

* Install [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and the plug-ins for elixir, erlang, and nodejs.
* Use asdf to install the proper versions of our languages: `asdf install`
* `mix test` from repo root should now work (you should see "XYZ tests, 0 failures" at the bottom of the output)
* To install frontend deps: `brew install yarn` and then `cd assets` and `yarn install`.

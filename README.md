# SignsUi

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install `yarn` with `npm install -g yarn`
  * Install JS dependencies with `pushd assets && yarn install && popd`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `USERNAME=username PASSWORD=password mix run --no-halt` (substituting whatever username/password you want)

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To get updates on the signs locally, run `realtime_signs` with a `SIGN_UI_URL` of the local url of `signs_ui`.
See that `README` for more details.
